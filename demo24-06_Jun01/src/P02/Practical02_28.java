    This file explores an exercise given to me by a representative of Synechron who wanted to guage my technical-abilities for a role at Citi-bank.
    (If I'm unsuccessful, Ronan doesn't need to know.)
    (20th Aug 2024?)

    He wanted me to create a method that could receive a list of numbers and figure out if 3 of the same number occurred.
    List<Integer> =  {10,20,12,24,15,17,18,19,20,20};
    I also think he wanted me to use stream (but i forgot how to do thar and defaulted to foreach and lambda expressions instead)

    The code i was originally using should be saved to the rig journals somewhere, i need to pull it in here at some point.
